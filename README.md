# Playwright in docker with hot reloading
Everything to run Playwright tests in in Docker, with hot reloading so you don't need to rebuild Docker for every test change.

To run:
```
docker-compose up
```

Change the test files within the **tests** folder, and run again to see the changes:
```
docker-compose up
```
